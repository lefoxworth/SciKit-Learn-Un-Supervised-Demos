# SciKit-Learn-Un-Supervised-Demos

Two short programs made using the SciKit Learn Python library.

The first, part1.py, uses an unsupervised learning algorithm to predict a z value given attributes x and y.

The second, part2.py, uses a supervised learning algorithm to identify the number and parameters of clusters of given data.

Created as a homework assignment for UA's CS 465 course.
